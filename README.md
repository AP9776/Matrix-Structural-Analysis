Instances of numerical methods used for structural analysis
# Direct Stiffness Method
This program uses Direct Stiffness Method to generate the Stiffness Matrix of a 2D structure, independent from the Loading condition.<br/>
The inputs include:<br/>
- Type of the Structure (Truss, Frame or a combination of them) <br/>
- Type(s) of material(s) (Elastic modulus of the material) <br/>
- Properties of elements (Cross-sectional area, length) <br/>
- Geometrical properties of the structure (Coordinates of the joints) <br/>
- Type(s) of the joints (Degrees of Freedom including horizontal, vetical and rotational) <br/>
- The outcome would be the Stiffness Matrix of the structure. <br/>
